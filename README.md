# 🌸 Iris Dataset Analysis  

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`iris_analysis.ipynb`) that explores and analyzes the **Iris dataset** 🌱—a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics. Using **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)**, the notebook demonstrates best practices in **data analysis, visualization, and insights sharing**.  

> ✨ Inspired by Ubuntu’s principle of *community*, this project emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and shareability.

## 📊 Project Overview  

The Iris dataset includes **150 samples of iris flowers**, each described by:  
- **4 numerical features**: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width  
- **1 categorical label**: species (*setosa, versicolor, virginica*)  

The notebook walks through:  
- ✅ Loading and exploring the dataset  
- 📈 Computing descriptive statistics & grouping by species  
- 🎨 Creating four visualizations (line chart, bar chart, histogram, scatter plot)  
- 🔎 Summarizing key findings (e.g. **petal length is a strong discriminator** between species)
